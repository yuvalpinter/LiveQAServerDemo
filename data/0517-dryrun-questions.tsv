For me, I ve always used ''lite'' tampons simply because it is more comfortable and I have a small vagina. When I got the IUD inserted it honestly was the worst pain I have experienced - I wanted to just tell them to stop (at the time I was 26 and I have had no prior pregnancies). I am so glad that I went through with it. I ve read about all the bad things that can happen with copper IUDs (i.e. terrible cramps, heavy periods). Myself, I have experienced slightly heavier periods however it is more that I spot a few days prior to bleeding. Nothing major it s just an annoyance. Also my periods last a day or two longer however they are still as light as they have been. Cramps are the worst part. I ve always had bad cramps and am prescribed vicodin in order to endure them. Sometimes between periods (usually during ovulation according to my phone app) cramps are unbearable. I ve always had terrible cramps though. They are even worse since getting the IUD however for me, it has been totally worth it. /n/nWhen I first got it I was cramping for a good while and bled for the two weeks prior to my period before things became ''normalized.'' Honestly there are parts about the copper IUD that I think suck (mainly the intense cramps between periods) but I will never suggest that anyone not do it. It is seriously amazing and for me, the cons are very, very slight when thinking of the benefits."

If yes, how much deviation will be noticeable to you(approximately...for me it can be more than 6 or 7cm in both directions to be categorized as long or short arms) /nThanks"	Men's Health	1463474839000YA:20160517014834AAMhVyq	How do you like this chair?

And the owner is just a buisnessman for a company and in the nba basketball what's the difference between the gm and president.

"I'm like 4kg underweight but I've never been more confident in my own skin. I finally have a thigh gap and I look amazing in clothes - skinny, but not to the point of being skeletal. I really don't want to gain weight because 4kgs ago, I was really self conscious of my flabby thighs and stomach fat. I never spend a second of the day feeling fat or gross anymore - and I don't want to go back to loathing my body (which is naturally shaped so that I have a really bony upper frame but a thicker and stubbier lower body). /nThe only reason I'm concerned about being underweight is that I'm still 14 and that I haven't had my period in 5 months - though this may have more to do with hormone issues and diet changes (I lost the 4kg after going vegetarian and cutting out junk/processed foods - I did this both for acne-related and moral-related reasons)./nI'm struggling with whether I should eat more and gain the weight. I know that gaining weight will make me, just like it will make any typical person (especially self conscious teenage girls!), extremely uncomfortable and unhappy. If I gain weight, I'll feel pudgy again - and I worked so hard and ate so clean to achieve the body I'm proud of right now./nEveryone is hounding at me to gain weight once they find out about me being underweight (only by 4kgs though), but no one would tell someone who is overweight by 4kgs to lose the weight?"

I have not spoken to him at all but I found him and his mother on Facebook. I really want to ask if he is okay and let them know that I forgive him and so does Jesus only thing is i don t want it to backfire on me and them try to say I m harassing them or something.

"Around 9 months ago I bleached my hair and then put a blonde dye over it because I had to go back to a natural colour for school. I had previously had a green semi-permanent in it but I got that completely out. My natural brown began to grow out obviously so I decided about 5 months ago to go back to brown and I dyed it a dark brown colour. Now this wasn't near my natural colour by any means, but it has faded slightly so it looks like I have some highlights now in a lighter brown shade. I'd like to start dying my hair unnatural colours again, but can't figure out if I should use a colour remover or just bleach my whole head. Because obviously the colour remover won't lift my regrowth so I will have to bleach my roots alongside the colour remover. Is it worth it to use the colour remover and try not to damage my hair as much or should I just bleach it and start with a blank canvas? I need some advise, because I don't want to waste money on a colour remover if I'm going to end up bleaching after it too.

But I had painful periods, once I was having sex (not regularly) I decided to go to the uni. gyno. /n/nI'm straight. I WANTED a male gyno because I feel more at ease with men. 2 yrs previous, a bf tried to rape me. I rolled from underneath him and stopped him because I'm more assertive with men. I was so desperate to get my uterus out of pain, I accepted a female./n/nI didn't do my research. I logically assumed a contraption would be inserted in me, and I was prepared for that. She gave me a quick warning, inserted it, I survived.I didn't realize she'd put her fingers in me but she gave me like 2 seconds warning and stuck them in...not enough time to process it. /n/nWhile inside me, she talked about doing her own kegels, asked about mine, told me the benefits for sex, and complimented my tightness. Fingering was still equivalent to sex for me at the time. I was already turned on (physically, not mentally) when going in there since I get arousal from needing to pee. I just feel stupid about it because with a man, I'd have already been on guard. HELL NO complimenting my vagina/talking about sexual things while inside of me./n/nI was shocked until I left the room and sobbed for hours and hours after./n/nNow I have to share a bedroom with a 50-yr old lady for an on-site job, it scares me.

I was going to replace the cat but I noticed there is what looks to be more then one on my car... My car has a Y shaped pipe so at the front end of the car its what looks to be a smaller cat on each side and on the tail its a large one. My questions are what cats are most likely to the bad ones?

"This question is for responsible Pit owners and/or trainers:  In addition to our 8 other dogs, we were ''blessed'' recently with a pit or pit-mix puppy.  We've fostered a lot of dogs, but we've tried to stay away from breeds that might not work well in our pack setting and/or farm animals. But what do you do? The rescues are FULL of casually-bred pit puppies.  We've tried to rehome him, but I honestly didn't completely trust the 2 people who applied for him, so it was either keep him ourselves & continue to try to place him or have him euthanized (he's only 6 weeks old.)   He's smart, strong-willled, loving, & everything you normally associate with this breed. He picked up ''sit'' after about 4 times, and we're teaching him what are his ''chew toys'' and what's NOT a chew-toy,  and that humans get to eat first, etc. My question, though, is about play-fighting. You can't do much about genetics, but we don't want to encourage any dog-aggression. He and our other younger dogs tussle as all puppies will (we have a young Dane female who's already 90 lbs. & also a scrappy little red heeler mix.)  Puppies are going to play, but should I curb rough-housing at some point? Is it good that he's ''fighting'' at a young age with dogs that can put his chubby little self on the ground, or will this just encourage him to want to fight even harder?  Again, I'm not taking owning this dog lightly, and I want to do everything I can to encourage his success in our household or in his future forever-home."

I have just finished university (England) for photography. I was talking to my parents about what I would need for an adult dog I would be getting (I would be rescuing one) and they asked me what breed I would be getting. I said, maybe a Pomeranian, Chihuahua or a Papillon (Yes I am aware I would need to go to a breed specific rescue centre) and they yelled at me for wanting a small dog. They themselves have a Great Dane, lovely dog, but I prefer small dogs. They said I am stupid for wanting one, and that they won't speak to me again if I got one, and never visit me. They said I will regret for the rest of my life. What should I do? Should I go ahead with adopting a dog and ignore them, or do what they say?"

I've read ''my brothers keeper'' and ''my brothers protector'' and really like the idea of them, but there's 3 of us...any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

"So I am almost 20 years old and I have ridges on my two front teeth that are noticeable and I'm insecure about it. I am not sure what these ridges are from but my best guess is just from when I was younger and my teeth were growing, you know what I mean? Well, they haven't gone away yet and I just want my two front teeth to be straight across with no ridges. I was wondering if it's okay to ask my dentist just to quickly file them down? I heard this can cause damage but honestly I don't care too much. The dentist would barely have to do anything because it's not a big ordeal like it's just little ridges only on my two front teeth. Last time I was at the dentist I quickly asked her and she said that it's best not to do that because it would cause damage and that the ridges would go away eventually. When I go back I am going to ask again but with probably a different lady and with my mom there lol lol. /n/nSo what I'm really asking is if this is okay to do? Can my dentist do this for me? /nThanks! 10 points given to the most helpful answer! :)"	Dental	1463501270000YA:20160517090913AA8egdV	Boxers in UFC?

The first time was just pee, but then the next two times were poop. And she will start whining inside because she has to go, so we go out, she whines more, and as soon as we get back inside she goes.

"Oreo is coming up on her 15th birthday, she is a medium sized mutt and has been in our family since she was 1 year old. For the last 2 years she has been gradually aging - losing her hearing, losing almost all of her eyesight, and developing arthritis in all her legs. In the past few months however, she has developed severe dog dementia. She hasn't wagged her tail in months, she only eats people food (won't touch dog food), and she doesn't recognize our other 2 dogs or family anymore. All day and night she wanders aimlessly in circles, trying to get stuck behind and under anything. We've closed off most of the house from her because she kept falling down stairs. She still goes outside every now and then but gets stuck in bushes and falls. I know it hurts her to get up, she's lost a lot of weight, and she shakes constantly when laying down. I took her to the vet last week and the vet said it was up to us, she wasn't quite ready to go. But now I'm not sure, she doesn't seem to have any happiness anymore, I'm sure she's in pain from walking in circles all day, and I don't know if she dreams anymore because she rarely sleeps. She's also lost a lot of weight, but mostly goes the bathroom outside. Is it time?"	Dogs	1463505589000YA:20160517102055AAWbG0N	"HELP!!!!Do I have low testosterone levels?

"I'm 21 years old, and all my life I dealt with some depression and major anxiety, I have some sort of speech disorder were sometimes words are much difficult for me to say as they come out of my mouth, also having A.D.D causes me to have some pretty bad social anxiety. My self-esteem is beyond horrible, I'm just having a serious issue with connecting and socializing with people.. /n/nHere are my symptoms:/n-Anxiety/Depression./n-Horrible speech./n-Unmotivated./n-Constant brain fog./n-Feeling unreal./n-Feeling very slow./n-Horrible focus./n-Extremely lazy. /n-Hopeless. /n-Feeling stupid./n-Mind races./n-Short term memory./n-Uncoordinated./n-Constantly tired/exhausted. /n-Socially awkward./n-Loss interest in things I once loved./n/nIt took me a very long time to figure out that the cause of my demise could be DPD, after years of wondering why I feel abnormal, tired, slow, out of place, having no connection, I believe I have found something that relates to exactly how I feel. Now I have read reports besides it having to do with depression, but the main reason why I feel out of place, uncoordinated, foggy, tired, etc.. is because of having very low testosterone. Is that something that can be a legitimate reason why I feel this way? My life needs to improve, I'm 21 years old and in the prime of my life. I want to feel in control in my life, meet people, fall in love and maybe one day start a life with someone. It's destroying my life.

They took her temperature and it was a little high and the vet said his first thought was FIP. He took a blood sample and a liquid sample of the liquid in her belly and sent it to a specialist. He also took an x-ray and said it just looks like a bunch of fluid in her stomach. He put her on two types of antibiotics and sent her home with us over the weekend. The test results for the FIP came back negative. So they did a leukemia test and that also came back negative. They then ran a test for FIV which came back negative. He did say they can sometimes be a false negative but feels as if it might be a really bad infection in her abdomen. (she had a huge abscess a few months back and he said the other vet could have possibly punctured her stomach lining or something) He said I have two options. /n1) bring her in for another blood sample and put her on another stronger antibiotics which would be about $200./n2) bring her in and take another sample of the fluid in her belly and also get an ultrasound. This would be about $600. /n/nHe did say that the ultrasound would allow him to look at her kidneys and liver and see if they are in good condition. /n/nWhat would you do in this situation? She still eats, drinks, jumps up on the furniture, and uses her cat box. She is also very aware of her surrounding i.e. when I call her name or open a can of cat food."

Initially it wouldn't start.   I cleaned the caroborator's bowl out.  There was a small deposit of gunk on the bottom   .  I spayed it out with some carborator cleaner and let it settle over night.   The following day I started it and it worked.   About 4 day later, I tried it again and it started pretty easily.   mid way through mowing it stopped again.   I then opened the tank and it appeared dry.   When I filled it, the tank overflowed a bit.   When I pulled to start, It only ran for about 10 seconds before puffing a bit of smoke and stalling out again.   I looked at the carborator,  sprayed some of it out and then installed it with the air filter, but it wouldn't start again.  This time I noticed gasoline leaking from a small hole on the carborator that is NOT from the bowl.   I don't know what to do.  I alread changed the oil and spark plugs.  Please help."

Should I take out the piercing?	"I've had my cartilage (upper ear) piercing for nearly two years. The process has been up and down. It would frequently get infected, but i'd clean the ear and it would be okay. However, I recently changed my piercing from a stud to a hoop, and the hoop is a lot thinner. Since then, my ear is incredibly red and there appears to be lump of some form (water/puss?) on the surface of the ear beside the piercing. The hole itself seems a little swollen. However, unlike in the past, there has been no pain or puss. Just the redness and bump. I'm wondering if because the hoop is smaller, the hole healed more, and as a result, the hole where discharge might come from was blocked and it has developed in the ear? I have no idea. I'm not sure whether to keep the piercing in or out until I go see a doctor."	Other - Skin & Body	1463516742000YA:20160517132718AAj8AYt	How much excersise does a Great Dane need?

Its like all the things that make me human are fading away and I'm scared of this. I don't see any point on living if I can't live my life with emotions because I feel like Half the experience and enjoyment of something is the emotion. I can't break from this really.

I already do track, and am a distance runner, so I can handle five or six miles runs, but from what people have told me, the typical Cross Country workout can be 20 400m's, two mile simulators, and forty hills. Also, I am one of the worst distance runners on the team (my mile time is 6:10). The reasons I want to do it is so I can improve my times for winter and spring track, and so I can get into better shape (im at a healthy weight, but still have some fat i wanna get rid of). I also really love running 5k's, and I heard the races are very similar to those, except with more hills. My main concern is the coach. If I start getting tired and doing bad during practice, then I am afraid he will get angry with me (I heard he does).

I put on any kind of shorts a 14 year old girl would wear and my mom just says that they're too short! Today I put on my sisters American eagle size 0 shorts on and the waistband was already too big. I showed my mom and she said that they are too short. I don't want to wear Bermuda shorts or anything long. I just want to wear regular shorts like a normal teenager. I was thinking of buying high waisted shorts and using them as regular ones because of how long my legs are. Is this a good idea? Any other options? Anything but really long shorts.

I placed two aqueon hang on filters filters (20- 40 gal) and they did well with keeping the water clear in between daily water changes.(every 3-4 days) After doing a ton of research I purchased the Api master test kit. I noticed after 3 weeks I was not building any nitrite or nitrate. So I did more research and discovered that I needed filter media.I removed the cartridges and added sponge and biomax rings. After just a day my water has became cloudy.  So I did more research and am going to purchase an aqua clear 60-110 as apparently the more gph is best. My concern is what filter media do I need to add besides the bio rings to keep the tank properly filtrated and clear while building beneficial bacteria?

If my best friend or girlfriend committed suicide I wouldn't care at all. I say I love you to my family but I don't really feel anything different about them. They're just people. And when my action or lack thereof causes someone close to me to be upset, I feel no guilt. I literally have no remorse. Is this normal or am I suffering from some other disorder I don't know about? I'm a little concerned."	Mental Health	1463528746000YA:20160517164704AA38MqV	Implantation bleeding or period? Please help!?	"My husband and I are not ready and do not have the desire to be parents at all currently, but I am nervous that I might be pregnant. My husband and I had sex but the condom broke, so I took plan B a few hours later. I know that Plan B can change your menstrual cycle because of the change in hormones. I think that this change in hormones also gave me a really bad yeast infection which I still have. Today when using the restroom, I noticed pink discharge when I wiped, and I also noticed some pink tissue emerging as well. Every website that I look on tells me that pink discharge is a sign of implantation, but I am really hoping that it is not. Throughout the afternoon, I have had cramps (just like I get when I get my period), some blood clots on the tampon, but the blood is still pink or just slightly darker and the flow is still kind of light. Please help me determine the difference between the two."	Women's Health	1463528824000YA:20160517164739AAP8MXU	Lots of discharge??

I know its normal to have some before and after a period (I'm on mine right now) I've tried everything, from baby powder, to pads and tampons. But somehow it always leaks onto my jeans and it looks like a peed myself! Like I've worn a pad AND tampon today, but it leaked and I walked around looking like I peed myself.

"I'm about to be a Junior in high school, and I am considering trying out for my high school football team, as a kicker and punter. I drill 35-40 yard field goals regularly, and punt about 35 yards per punt. I'm a kicker, punting is my secondary position. I'm 5'9 and 125 pounds. I'm passionate about football, and the idea of me playing football with my build and the low risk of injury is really appealing to me. However, as I stated before, I'm only 5'9 and 125 pounds. I'm worried that I might be bullied if I make the team because of my build. Do high school football players do that?  Or do they lay off because I'm part of the team? I also am wondering: Is it worth it? Is it fun? Is it worth practicing all August and playing though rain and snow with the team? I played baseball for 18 seasons, I understand the bond you form with the team. But some of the football players at my school look like a bunch of losers with straight C's and D's on their report cards, and it's hard to believe friendship is possible. What do you think? Is it worth it? Can I do it? Are those guys better people than they appear to be? Thanks for all your input."

"My sister got a code for a missfire on cylinder 1. We decided to change all spark plug and wires. I double check everything was right via the manual. After the chage the truck was running strong. The only problem was a manifold gasket leak.(it was vibrating a little, barely noticeable.) I don't have the tools and I didn't want to risk breaking a bolt. So we bought the gasket and took to a shop to get it put on. They guy pointed out we should get a head gasket change to since it was leaking a little oil. (it was) So we did. Three days go by and the guy called us and said that the previous guy who worked on it had broken the engine.(me) He said that the spark plug are too big that it hit the cylinder hence the lost of compression. He showed me some bent spark plugs. Then he told me it was because the lost of compression through the spark plugs that didn't fit. Well I took the truck home and the was vibrating violently and smoking A LOT. Big white cloud behind me. As soon as I got home the truck does not want to turn on. They want to change my engine block!

There are less QBs there and it would be a fresh start./n/nI want to hear relevant thoughts. Thank you. :)"	Football (American)	1463538064000YA:20160517192201AAspq1C	Fedex tracking question?

"Ok so on a serious note, I need some insight on how to become bigger mass and muscle wise in order to throw faster. Yes I am a pitcher. I m a very promising pitcher, but the problem I have is that I throw between 75-80 mph and I am only 140 lbs. Height is no problem, I m 6 foot 1 inch, and to add on to this, I am a lefty. I can definelty compete as a pitcher, but my main goal is to play at the college level and later on in life past highschool (Currently I am a sophomore - Class of 2018). Can anyone recommend workouts to gain velocity or supplements to use in order to gain muscle/mass efficiently without deteriorating my body in the aftermath. If anyone could educate me on this, it would be helpful! I would prefer though for someone who has gone through this same experience and how it played out for them to answer if possible. Thank you!"

"I started a Suboxone treatment program two days ago (2mg a day) for opiate relapses, cravings, and essentially addiction. The subs are working great for this and I feel like it s eased my depression and anxiety as well. I m also prescribed Klonopin 4mg/day and was drug tested prior to receiving my prescription for suboxone. However, I take the Klonopin in 1mg doses twice a day and my doctor that prescribes suboxone has told me I have to quit taking the Klonopin immediately and I will be drug tested in a week and if I want my prescription refilled, I cannot test positive for Benzos. I ve been on Klonopin for about a year and a half now. My problem is I m not quite sure what to do. I haven t taken the Klonopin in nearly 48 hours and so far I can t notice any withdrawal from it (I know it has an extremely long half-life). I ve tried coming off the Klonopin (voluntarily) before and got down to .5mg daily and couldn t stand the withdrawal (headaches, shakes, insomnia, restless-legs, etc.) then I continued back on it. If I discontinue my Klonopin (cold-turkey), can I expect WDs from that? And is it possible to test positive for it if I haven t taken it over the week I was directed not to? The Doctor was adamant about me not testing positive for Benzos and the she will not re-prescribe the Suboxone again. The treatment of opiate addiction is more valuable to me than ridding myself of anxiety."

"the question for my college history class is:/n''What are the residual economic and social effects of slavery?/n/nmy answer:/nSlavery still continues to have economic and social effect in the U.S. After the Civil war, slaves were not helped to be acclimated into the mainstream of society. Many returned to the plantations and worked in the sharecropping system. This began decades of discrimination and hate. Anything negative about slaves had been passed on from generation to generation. With harassment, intimidation, and murder under the belief of black inferiority and white superiority (such as the Ku Klux Klan when former Confederate soldiers formed a quasi-military to resist racial integration and preserve white supremacy), racism began under slavery which is still here today as Africans are sometimes still not treated as social equals and there are no guarantees of social equality between the races. On the positive, there is a merge of black culture in the U.S. today in music, language, and religion. The end to slavery also meant that the old social and economic order is gone and slaves are now citizens. The North however, economically benefited from the end to /nslavery which was important in establishing the U.S. as a world economic power./n/ndid I answer the question? I don't really know what to say about the residual effect of slavery on the economy. Do you think my answer is good?"	History	1463544934000YA:20160517211631AAQ6qq0	How much protein do I need?

"On its own, my skin is not that bad and I would be able to get away with just concealer... if there was any in my skin tone. I am naturally quite pale, therefore dark circles and a little bit of redness due to an occasional pimple (usually in the most visible portion of my face, aka. between the eyebrows or on the nose) are quite visible and obvious. I have found that even the lightest concealers are usually darker than the lightest shade of foundation. Therefore, instead of using a concealer, I usually resort to foundation. However, even the lightest foundation that I ve found has been too dark for my skin, so I end up having to practically bathe myself in the foundation just to cover up one sleepless night or one unfortunately placed zit.

"I was gargling with 2 tablespoons of salt mixed with about 1/3 cup of water and accidentally swallowed all of it. I didn t puke. But I did feel a little nauseated after. This happened about 10:45 pm and it is now a little past  midnight. I m 29 years old and weight 151 lbs. My husband really freaked me out and started saying that it was very harmful, etc. I m scared. I called poison control but I don t think the woman understood my problem and it was of very little help. If something were to occur, how soon after ingesting would it happen?"

"Going to try to make this post without sounding like a clingy psycho dog owner.. here I go: My dog spends all the time with my mom, and I think I have a full right to be pissed off. I bought my dog when I was living alone. I got her for companionship after going through a bad heartbreak and depression, I needed some light in my life..so I got a dog.  Ever since moving in with my mom to help with my college bills, I rarely see her. My dog became obsessed with my mom, and no one else exists when mom is around. I have to constantly force my dog to spend time with me, before she starts begging to go spend time with mom. I'm the primary caretaker. I play with her,  I train her, I take her to the vet,, I take her to the groomer. Essentially, I got her myself and raised her myself. And now I barely get to see her. It's like I don't even exist. My mom is a very good caring person, but i'm beginning to resent her and my dog because of this. I'm very frustrated. I'm not clingy, I just want my dog to be able to sit/nap on my bed after I come home from a stressful day, without having me force her to do that. Its like im constantly fighting for her attention. If I wanted just a  pet, I could of got a CAT. I got a DOG because I wanted to be selfish and have it as MY OWN child.  Now, busy and stressed out af, I need my dog more than ever. /nCan someone shine some light on this? Am crazy for getting angry about this?  How do I go about dealing with this?"

He is 8 months old and came from a home where he was attacked by pitbulls. We have noticed he is insecure in the way that when he meets men and other dogs his first reaction is to growl and bark. He hasn't bitten anyone, and once given adequate time to sniff the dog (if the dog is confident and doesn't do anything back), he is fine. He takes a little while to trust men. I am assuming he wasn't socialized properly as well. Therefore, I have been taking him out a lot, and trying to get him to meet as many dogs and people possible. He's doing ok, I was just wondering if I keep socializing him, if this will go away? Is there something else I should be doing? I try not to reward him for his insecure behavior, but for when he is relaxed and accepts new people."	Dogs	1463555647000
